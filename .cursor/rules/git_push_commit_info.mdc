# Git Commit and Push Info

When performing `git commit`:
- Provide a clear, descriptive commit message.
- Stage files with `git add <file>` or `git add .` before committing.
- Use:
  ```
  git commit -m "<commit message>"
  ```

When performing `git push`:
- Ensure a remote repository URL is configured (e.g., `git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git` or HTTPS).
- Specify the remote name (usually `origin`) and the branch (e.g., `main`).
- Provide authentication credentials (personal access token or SSH key).
- For the first push to set upstream, use:
  ```
  git push -u origin main
  ```
- Subsequent pushes can use:
  ```
  git push
  ```

Use these steps to commit changes locally and push them to a remote repository seamlessly.
