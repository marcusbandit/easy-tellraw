# Prevent Automatic Builds

The AI assistant must not execute any build or installation commands without an explicit user request.

Rules:
- Never propose or run `npm run build`, `npm run dist`, `npm install`, or similar commands on your own.
- Only invoke build or install scripts when the user directly asks (e.g., “please build” or “run npm run build”).
