- Add a feild in the tellraw editor: Node Name
- I wanna make it so when i click any node it smothly focusus the actual node if it is an instance of a node. When a node is selected. Then if i go to edit mode it will be that nodes tellraw i see.
- I wanna add a new tab called Raw view. This is basicaly jst a text editor. The Dialouge.txt will be shown here in raw. And automaticaly updated when we change things. But wil aswell update the rest of things if edited. We will need a linter fro it to detect errors.
- I need to make nodes render corretly in the graph view. Currently they dont respect the specefied meta they are getting. fx "{intalic}Some text here{/} is looking nice".
- Add a new node type: Activation node. This is for teh possibility to add in what needs to happen for the first tellraw to be generated.
